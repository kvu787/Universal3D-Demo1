# I created this .gitignore file by analyzing these two ignore files:
#   1. ignore.conf generated when creating a Unity project from a built-in template and enabling Unity Version Control
#   2. The Unity.gitignore file from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore
#
# This file matches less stuff than either of those file because I want to stay on the cautious side by not ignoring files that shouldn't be ignored.
# I will add things to this file as I encounter more things that I'm certain should be ignored.

# Hi, Unity constantly creates and deletes these files in directories, which negatively impacts Plastic’s performance by continuously triggering the change detection. To address this, a rule is automatically added to ignore.conf.
# If a user doesn’t have this rule, it gets added. In new projects, it’s already included in the predefined ignore rules.
# In summary, this rule must be present, which is why it keeps being created. While predefined actions are generally not ideal, this is an exceptional case due to its impact.
# Users can’t normally see these files because they are created and deleted within milliseconds, but they still trigger the file system watcher and they are not ignored, it can heavily impact the performance of the pending changes calculation.

# I use this folder when doing a standalone build operation and Unity Editor asks for a folder.
# I don't want to use the existing /Build/ or /Builds/ ignored folders to avoid potential conflicts.
