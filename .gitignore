# I created this .gitignore file by analyzing these two ignore files:
#   1. ignore.conf generated when creating a Unity project from a built-in template and enabling Unity Version Control
#   2. The Unity.gitignore file from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore
#
# This file matches less stuff than either of those file because I want to stay on the cautious side by not ignoring files that shouldn't be ignored.
# I will add things to this file as I encounter more things that I'm certain should be ignored.
#

# This is a local cache for the Unity project. It stores Unity's internal, game-ready representations of source assets (e.g., converted textures, models, etc.), cached data, and project-specific settings.
/Library/

# This stores stuff that is specific to an individual developer's Unity Editor for this specific project.
/UserSettings/

# This stores temporary files that Unity uses internally during operation, such as intermediate build files, lock files (like UnityLockFile), and temporary scene data when entering play mode.
/Temp/

# This stores logs generated by Unity Editor.
/Logs/

# Visual Studio uses this folder to store user-specific settings.
/.vs/

# Visual Studio Code uses this folder to store user-specific settings.
/.vscode/

# These are Visual Studio project files that are auto-generated by Unity based on other files.
# They shouldn't be checked in because Unity treats these as intermediate build artifacts, instead of build inputs.
/*.csproj
/*.sln

# I use this folder when doing a standalone build operation and Unity Editor asks for a folder.
# I don't want to use the existing /Build/ or /Builds/ ignored folders to avoid potential conflicts.
/MyBuildFolder/
